# Clustering-Music-Genres
Clustering is a machine learning technique to group data points characterized by specific features. Clustering music genres is a task of grouping music based on the similarities in their audio characteristics. 
# Introduction
Every person has a different taste in music. We cannot identify what kind of music does a person likes by just knowing about their lifestyle, hobbies, or profession. So it is difficult for music streaming applications to recommend music to a person. But if we know what kind of songs a person listens to daily, we can find similarities in all the music files and recommend similar music to the person. That is where the cluster analysis of music genres comes in. Here you are given a dataset of popular songs on Spotify, which contains artists and music names with all audio characteristics of each music. Your goal is to group music genres based on similarities in their audio characteristics.
# Conclusion
I will use the K-means clustering algorithm to find the similarities between all the audio features. Then I will add clusters in the dataset based on the similarities we found. So letâ€™s create a new dataset of all the audio characteristics and perform clustering analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. So this is how you can perform cluster analysis of music genres with machine learning using Python. Clustering music genres is a task of grouping music based on the similarities in their audio features.
